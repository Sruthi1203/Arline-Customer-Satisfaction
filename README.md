# Airline Customer Satisfaction

**Funding Opportunity: Enhancing Airline Passenger Satisfaction Through Data Analytics**

**Overview:** The \[Air Travel Experience Innovation Fund (ATEIF)\] invites proposals for projects aimed at improving airline passenger satisfaction by leveraging machine learning and data-driven strategies. With air travel becoming increasingly competitive, this opportunity supports research that uses data analytics to better understand factors driving passenger satisfaction and to propose actionable recommendations for airlines to enhance customer experiences.

**Data:** <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction>

**Objective:** This funding opportunity encourages the use of the **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset** from Kaggle to uncover key factors that influence passenger satisfaction. Researchers should focus on building models to predict satisfaction, identifying improvement areas for airlines, and developing insights into the relationship between flight services and customer experiences.

**Dataset Information:** The dataset contains **over 20,000 records** with the following features related to passenger demographics, flight information, and feedback:

- **Gender**, **Age**, **Customer Type** (Loyal, Disloyal)
- **Type of Travel** (Business, Personal)
- **Class** (Eco, Eco Plus, Business)
- **Flight Distance**
- **Inflight Wifi Service**, **Food and Drink**, **Seat Comfort**, **Inflight Entertainment**, **Baggage Handling**, etc.
- **Departure Delay in Minutes**, **Arrival Delay in Minutes**
- **Satisfaction** (Satisfied/Neutral or Dissatisfied)

This dataset provides a rich source of information to analyze factors affecting passenger satisfaction with airlines globally.

**Focus Areas:**

1. **Predictive Modeling for Satisfaction**: Develop predictive models using machine learning to accurately classify passengers as satisfied or dissatisfied based on their flight experience and personal characteristics.
2. **Key Driver Identification**: Perform feature importance analysis to identify which aspects of the flight experience (e.g., seat comfort, inflight services, delays) have the greatest impact on passenger satisfaction.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Use clustering techniques to segment passengers based on their satisfaction levels, flight class, or type of travel, providing airlines with actionable insights to tailor services for different customer groups.
4. **Delay Impact Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between flight delays and passenger dissatisfaction, offering recommendations on how airlines can mitigate negative perceptions caused by operational inefficiencies.
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Develop a framework for airlines to offer personalized recommendations and services based on customer preferences and satisfaction data to improve their flying experience.
6. **Visualization and Reporting**: Create user-friendly dashboards or visualizations that allow airline management teams to track passenger satisfaction trends and identify areas of service improvement in real-time.

**Eligibility:**

- Open to data scientists, business analysts, and researchers in the fields of aviation, hospitality, or customer experience.
- Experience in customer satisfaction analysis or predictive modeling is preferred.

**Funding Amount:** Projects will be funded up to **$200,000** for a duration of **1.5 months**.

**Submission Guidelines:** Proposals must include:

- A **research plan** (up to 2 pages) detailing the research questions, methodology, and expected outcomes.
- A **timeline** and budget that outlines how the funds will be used.
- **Previous work and team expertise** or publications relevant to customer experience or airline operations (if applicable).

**Important Dates:**

- **Application Deadline**: October 15, 2024
